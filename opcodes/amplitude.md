100% amplitude meaning no volume change is applied to the sample when played.
Can be modulated with MIDI CC.

## Examples

```
amplitude=12
amplitude=40
amplitude_oncc108=100
amplitude_oncc50=35
```

When modulated by MIDI CC, this is a very convenient way to set up a volume
control which goes from silence to full volume.
