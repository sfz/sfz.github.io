# Global section

Statements in this section shall apply to the entire SFZ instrument. In practice
you may use this section to place articulation settings which should fit for most
of the part of your instrument. For example you may assign certain envelope
settings in the <[`global`]()> section of your instrument's sfz file and if you
need a certain other envelope setting at a certain key or key range, you may
override this default envelope setting with a <`group`> section or <`region`>
section.
