title: XML instrument bank
---
An ARIA-specific element, an XML bank is a collection of several SFZ instruments
in one instrument bank. Though technically not part of the SFZ format, it is
relevant to instrument creation for ARIA. The [#define] directive can also
be used at the bank level, but otherwise there is no SFZ there.
XML banks for ARIA must be digitally signed by Plogue - contact them if
interested in creating instruments with banks and graphical user interfaces.
