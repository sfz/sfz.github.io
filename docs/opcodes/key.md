Because of this, it is a very useful and convenient opcode for instruments which
do not need to spread a sample across multiple notes.
That means most chromatically sampled instruments or drum kits.
`key` values can be specified in MIDI note numbers (0-127) or note names
(IPN Standard). Numbers generally are better to use for getting the SFZ to
behave the same in all DAWs.

## Example

These two conventions will yield the same key mapping:

```sfz
key=72
// or
key=c5
```

Both are also equivalent to:

```sfz
lokey=72 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72
```

Key can also be combined with the others, which will override the value set by key
although key should be specified first. In ARIA, the value set by [pitch_keycenter]
will always be used, whether key or pitch_keycenter is set first in the SFZ file.
However, in some other players, setting pitch_keycenter to a different value than key
is only effective if key is set first and pitch_keycenter second. Therefore, for
compatibility, it is best to set key first, and pitch_keycenter later.

```sfz
key=72 lokey=70
```

Will be equivalent to

```sfz
lokey=70 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72
```

However, this would just be the same as setting key=72, as key comes later and
the lokey value it would set will override the previous lokey.

```sfz
lokey=70 key=72
```
