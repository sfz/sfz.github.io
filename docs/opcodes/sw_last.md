`sw_last` can be entered in either MIDI note numbers (0 to 127) or in MIDI note
names (C-1 to G9)

## Example

```sfz
sw_last=49
```

This is commonly used to select articulations, for example to switch between
sustain, staccato, spiccato and pizzicato in a violin. With the SFZ 1 or SFZ 2
spec, an instrument which uses `sw_last` to select articulations will not have a
default articulation preselected, meaning when loaded, it will play no sound
until one of the keyswitches is pressed - only after that will the instrument
respond to notes. The ARIA extensions include [sw_default]
as a solution to this.

The difference between this and [sw_down] is that sw_last
is a "sticky" keyswitch - after releasing the keyswitch note, it continues to
affect notes until another keyswitch is pressed. [sw_down],
on the other hand, is "non-sticky" and only affects notes played while
the switch is held down. This makes `sw_last` a good choice for keyswitching
articulations which are often used for many notes in a row,
such as sustain or staccato.
An example of using `sw_last` to select oscillator waves, with [sw_default]
used to set the sine to default as well.

// Notes 36,38 and 40 serve as switches to trigger sine, triangle or saw oscillators.
// you can expand on this concept to create your own KeySwitching instruments.
