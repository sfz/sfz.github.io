Assuming [oscillator_mode]=0:

- If the value is 1, the region operates normally, in single oscillator mode.
- If the value is 2, the region operates in ring modulation mode.
- If between 3 and 9, this defines a unison,
  with the value being the number of oscillators.
  In this case, [oscillator_detune] must also be set
  to indicate the spread between the oscillators.

## Cakewalk unison

Let `m` be the number of oscillators defined by `oscillator_multi`,
and `d` the detune value defined by [oscillator_detune].

The array of m oscillators is tuned by multiplying `d`
for each oscillator by its coefficient.

| Oscillator | Coefficient |
|   :---:    |    :---:    |
|     1      |      0      |
|     2      |     -1      |
|     3      |      1      |
|     4      |    -1/4     |
|     5      |     1/4     |
|     6      |    -1/2     |
|     7      |     1/2     |
|     8      |    -3/4     |
|     9      |     3/4     |

The oscillators sum into left and right channels with declining linear gain,
opposite for each channel.
With `i` the number of the oscillator (starting at 1),
the left gain is `(i-1)/(m-1)`, and the right gain is `1-((i-1)/(m-1))`.
