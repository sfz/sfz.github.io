If this is set to the same value as [bend_stepdown],
the result is the same as using [bend_step].

## Examples

```
bend_stepup=100 // glissando in semitones
bend_stepup=200 // glissando in whole tones
bend_stepup=1200 //leap an entire octave at a time
```


[bend_step]:     bend_step
[bend_stepdown]: bend_stepdown
