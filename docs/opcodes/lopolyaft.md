## Example

The region will play only if last Polyphonic Aftertouch message received was
in the 30-100 range.

```
lopolyaft=30 hipolyaft=100
```

## Practical Considerations

In the rgcaudio sfz player, the incoming note information in the Polyphonic
Aftertouch message is not relevant (which basically means polyphonic aftertouch
isn't polyphonic, and works like channel aftertouch). In ARIA, the incoming note
information is used, and polyphonic aftertouch works polyphonically.
Other SFZ players need testing.
