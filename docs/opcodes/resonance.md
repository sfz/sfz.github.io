## Example

```
resonance=4
resonance_oncc100=3
resonance2=3.2
```
There are two filters in series - the resonance of one is controlled by resonance,
that of the second by resonance2.

Raising this can easily result in a very large boost to frequencies around
the cutoff, which can result in extremely loud output!
