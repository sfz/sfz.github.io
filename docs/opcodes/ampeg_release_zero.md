When 1, indicates release time is the time it would take to get
from 0dBs to -oo (actually -90 dB as implemented in ARIA), NOT the time
to get from the current sustain to zero.

In other words, under default behavior, the release time is fixed, while
setting this to 1 makes the release slope fixed but time will be shorter
when sustain level is lower.

## Examples

```
ampeg_release_zero=1
ampeg_release_zero=0
```
