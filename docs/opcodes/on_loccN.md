Sample trigger on MIDI continuous control N.
This does not involve playing any MIDI notes.

## Example

```
on_locc64=127 on_hicc64=127
```

Region will play when a MIDI CC64 (sustain pedal) message with 127 value is
received. So, basically, when the sustain pedal is pressed down, this region will play.
This is useful with piano pedals - in the above example, `on_loccN` and `on_hiccN`
could be used to trigger a mechanical noise sample, whether any keys are being played
or not. It would not typically be used with hi-hat pedals, as most electronic drum kits
will send a MIDI note when the pedal hits bottom.

## Practical Considerations

on_locc/on_hicc effectively replaces the default [trigger](/opcodes/trigger)=attack.
The behavior of a region which has on_locc/on_hicc and trigger=attack both explicitly
specified is not defined by the SFZ specification, and that combination should be used.

In ARIA if on_locc/on_hicc and trigger=release or trigger=release_key is used, the
on_locc/on_hicc opcode will be effectively disregarded, and the region will behave
like a normal release or release_key region.
