We have two new articles explaining the modulations possible in [SFZ1](/tutorials/sfz1_modulations)
and [SFZ2](/tutorials/sfz2_modulations). Hopefully it will now be much easier to understand
what's possible under each spec level, and just what those complex SFZ2 LFOs and envelopes can
and can't do.
