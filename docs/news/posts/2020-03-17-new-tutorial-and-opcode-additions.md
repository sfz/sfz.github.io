A new tutorial about [subtractive synthesizers] was shared by DSmolken's
sample instruments experience applied in the [Caveman Cosmonaut] sample library.<br>
Some fixes and additions were made in our opcode database and in software as well,
like the Windows [OpenMPT] music tracker by sagamusix.<br>
New contributions was provided by other users like jisaacstone,
and a big contribution from jpcima for the [effects] section.<br>
Now we have also a new page for convenience
that lists [all opcodes] present in our database.
