We've published a [new tutorial](/tutorials/brush_stirs) explaining how to use samples to
model brushed drum techniques which produce a continuous sound
rather than a discrete hit. Admittedly, this is a rather niche technique not only
in the samples world but also in real-world music, mainly used in
jazz and some indie music. Next we plan to expand the [vibrato tutorial](/tutorials/vibrato),
which is currently only a simple code example.

Minor updates:
+ global_label, master_label, group_label and region_label opcodes added.
+ Added Carla and Bliss Sampler to SFZ players, updated TAL Sampler info.
