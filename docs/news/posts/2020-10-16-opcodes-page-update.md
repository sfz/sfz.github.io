For those who missed it we have some updates on the website, mainly regarding
the opcodes page. Recently I've added a [javascript library] that permits tables
column sorting, and now with an awesome contribution from @jpcima also a script
to filter opcode names, versions and categories. Hope you'll find them handy!

[javascript library]: https://bootstrap-table.com
