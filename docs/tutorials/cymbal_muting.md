title: Cymbal muting
---
A lot of the information in this article deals with implementing sampled hi-hats
and cymbals in general, and although the code examples are in SFZ, the principles
should also apply to other samplers, or even synthesized cymbals.
Muting previously played notes is important with monophonic instruments, such as
flutes or trumpets. With hi-hats, it is also crucial to sounding like a hi-hat -
an open hi-hat hit will be muted in real life when the hi-hat pedal is closed.
Let's start with a simple hi-hat with closed hit, foot chik, half-open and open
samples, with the latter two on the same key and degree of openness selected by
MIDI CC 4 - the common hi-hat pedal assignment in electronic drum kits.

```sfz
<region>key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav
<region>key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav
<region>key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63
<region>key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64
```

## Simple self-muting

The above hi-hat has no muting implemented, so playing
a closed hit after an open one would result in the open hit unrealistically
continuing to ring. The simplest way to take care of that is to put all the
regions in the same [‹group›] and use [off_by] to make that group mute itself -
that will mean any hi-hat hit will mute any currently playing hi-hat hit.
Setting [off_mode] to normal and using [ampeg_release]
or [off_time] to set the time it takes for the previous sample to fade out
also helps this sound a bit more natural.

```sfz
<group>
off_mode=normal
ampeg_release=0.07
<region>key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=1 off_by=1
<region>key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=1 off_by=1
<region>key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=1 off_by=1
<region>key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=1
```

## Hierarchical self-muting

This is the way many virtual drum kits work, but it is not fully satisfactory if,
for example, playing a ride pattern on an open hi-hat. Things do start getting more
complicated here, though, and many developers feel that it's enough to stop here, just
implement the above rules, and have a reasonably working virtual hi-hat. For those
who want more, however, Peter L. Jones has developed a hierarchy of muting, where
hits which are more closed mute hits that are more open, but hits which are
more open do not mute hits which are more closed. Hits also don't mute hits with
the same degree of openness.

So, chiks mute all hits, closed hits mute any partially open hits but not chiks
or closed hits etc. With this amount of degrees of openness, half-open hits would
mute open hits, and open hits would mute nothing. So, we need to put each hi-hat
articulation in a different group. This, however, means we need a group which
mutes several other groups, and regions in a group cannot have multiple or
varying off_by values. So, what we have to do is use silence - either the silence*
setting of [sample] ARIA extension, or an actual file of a short silence.
Note that the silence samples also have to have off_by settings
the same as the hi-hat samples in their mute group. Also, since group 1 doesn't
mute anything, we don't need to add any silence regions to that group.
Note that the [group] opcode used here and the [‹group›]
header are completely separate concepts - "group" for the remainder of this
article refers to the opcode, not the header, though group headers are also used
in the code examples.

```sfz
<group>
// Here are the hi-hat samples
off_mode=normal
ampeg_release=0.07

<region>key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=3 off_by=4
<region>key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=4
<region>key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=2 off_by=3
<region>key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=2

<group>group=2 off_by=3
// The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open
sample=*silence
loop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast
ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0
<region> key=42
<region> key=44
<region> key=46 hicc4=63

<group>group=3 off_by=4
// The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed and chik
loop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast
ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0
<region> key=42
<region> key=44

<group>group=4
// The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik
loop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast
ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0
<region> key=44
```

## Special treatment of foot splashes

The above isn't perfect - for example, fully opening up a hi-hat after playing
a hard half-open hit in the real world would stop the clashes between the top
and bottom, effectively stopping a half-open sound and replacing it with quieter
open ringing - but it is a reasonable compromise covering various degrees of
openness. Also, the more degrees of openness there are, the more groups will be needed.

There are, however, more hi-hat articulations possible. One which has special
behavior when it comes to muting is the foot splash - closing the hi-hat with
the pedal, then quickly reopening it. This articulation needs to mute itself,
because playing one foot splash after another involves closing the hi-hat, which
will mute the ringing.

Whether the splash should mute other types of hits is an open question, however.
Splashes, especially gentler ones, involve only momentary contact of the cymbal
edges and not complete closure. Whether an open hi-hat hit followed by a splash
sounds better when the splash mutes the open hit is left as a decision to the
reader.

The below example has the splash muting everything else, except for pedal chiks,
because it invovles closing the hi-hat fully. So, if a
kit has foot splash samples (for which there is no standard general MIDI note
assignment, so let's use 54 here - an octave above the chik, though in general
MIDI that's supposed to be the cowbell note), we'd need to set up one more group,
and have that mute itself. It will also need to be muted by all other types of
hi-hat hits, except for fully open hits.

```sfz
<group>
//Here are the hi-hat samples

ampeg_release=0.07

```

## Limiting polyphony

This works reasonably well. Another potential refinement is to also avoid
excessive buildup when the more open articulations (which with some hi-hat pairs
can ring for upwards of 20 seconds), while still allowing enough for ride
patterns on an open hi-hat to sound right. We can do this by using the [polyphony]
opcode to put a limit on the number of polyphony voices used by a specific group.
Note this must be set for the silence regions, also, so that every region in a
group will have the same off_by and polyphony as all the other regions in that
group. Polyphony of 4 for the open hi-hats and 3 for the half-open are judgment
calls. Drier cymbals and articulations with less sustain will generally sound
realistic with lower numbers here, and brushes might need a lower number than
sticks. Limiting the polyphony for the more closed articulations is not necessary
in practice, unless playing unrealistically dense trap hi-hat patterns, because
they don't ring very long anyway. Limiting the polyphony for the foot splash is
not necessary at all, because it mutes itself.

```sfz

## Edge cases

The above can sound strange when a hard hi-hat hit is being muted by a much quieter one. If
the hit doing the muting is both quiet and short, it can be practically inaudible, and the
resulting sound seems to only be the open hit, suddenly fading out. This is especially risky
if using amp_veltrack set to 100, which will make hits with very low velocity extremely quiet,
or if the lowest dynamic layers of more closed hits and foot chiks are recorded very quietly.

Lowering amp_veltrack for the lowest velocity layers is one potential way to reduce this
problem, as is setting amp_velcurve_1 to some value around 0.2 to 0.5 (higher values if there
are more dynamic layers).

In real life, however, a hard open hi-hat hit would have reduced in volume before the start
of the soft closed hit, as the pedal needs to be closed before a closed hit can be made.
This would, of course, cause many edge clashes along the way, which we do not have a way
to emulate. However, it is possible to use the pedal's MIDI CC to make the open sample quieter
outside of the range where the open hi-hat sample would be triggered. This can be done by modulating
the hi-hat's [amplitude], and applying a [‹curve›] which will
keep the amplitude at 100% unless the pedal is a good deal more closed than it was when the sample was triggered.

```sfz
<group>
//Here are the hi-hat samples
off_mode=normal
ampeg_release=0.07

<region>key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=4 off_by=5
<region>key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=5
<region>key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150
<region>key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150
<region>key=54 sample=hh_splash.wav group=1 off_by=1

<curve>curve_index=21
v000=0.13
v037=0.8
v077=1
v127=1

<curve>curve_index=22
v000=0.1
v037=0.7
v077=1
v127=1
```

Using smoothing on the amplitude modulation helps avoid sudden jumps, though playing an
open hit, closing the hi-hat pedal most of the way and then reopening it will still
result in obviously unrealistic volume fluctuations. So, this is not a perfect solution
by any means.

It's probably better to do this by using a volume envelope and using CC4 to modulate its
decay time, with the sustain set to a low level. and the [ampeg_dynamic] opcode
set to 1 so that moving the pedal will cause the decay time to be recalculated.
However, that has not been tested yet, as the author's test kit was already using envelopes
on the hi-hat to emulate drier cymbals.

Also, applying this to splash samples, which involve the pedal starting closed and opening
rapidly, is another problem which requires a solution.

## Multimic samples

So far, each hi-hat articulation has only one sample, which will obviously not
be the case in most virtual drum kits. This does not add much complexity, though,
as the samples for each degree of openness simply need to all be in the same group.
All half-open samples, for example, including all round robins, all velocity layers,
can share the same group.

If there are separate articulations for each degree of openness, such as shank,
tip and bell, those can also all be on the same group. Brushes, sticks and
mallets can often also share the same groups, unless the brushes need lower
polyphony numbers. However, if there are separate samples for different
microphones and the groups are self-muting, they will need to be in different
groups. In the current example, only the footsplash is self-muting, but if using
the simpler rules where all hi-hat articulations mute all others, all groups are
self-muting. So, having separate close hi-hat mic and a stereo overhead pair
would mean twice as many of those groups (assuming the stereo overheads are in
the L and R channel of the same sample), and close hi-hat, stereo overheads,
close room and far room would mean four times as many. The polyphony numbers for
groups which have polyphony will also have to be multiplied by the same factor.
Here is an example with close and overhead, with slightly longer fadeout times
for the more distant overhead mics:

```sfz
<group>
//Here are the hi-hat samples

```

## Header organization

That is as complex as it gets, though there are a few minor points to be aware of.
Many drum kits with round robins will set [seq_length]
at the [‹global›] level, and in those cases, the silence regions
would only trigger for the first hit in the round robin sequence, unless they
have seq_length set to 1 to override the global setting. Also, the [‹master›]
header level and [#include] statement are useful ARIA
extensions for keeping deeply sampled hi-hat mappings organized.

## Cymbals other than hi-hats

Cymbals other than hi-hats are simpler, but there are
two considerations when muting those. One is limiting polyphony, which is
especially important with cymbals intended for playing rolls, and with jazz ride
cymbals (rock/metal rides which primarily use the bell articulation, not as much).
The other is that it's also possible to record separate choke samples, and have
those mute everything else. A ride with bell, bow and edge articulations, choke
samples and overhead and room mics might be set up like below. Note that while
each articulation has its own groups and different polyphony limits, all
articulations for each mic have the same off_by value, which is the group value
of the choke samples for that mic. It would not be necessary to have this many
groups to implement muting, but this setup would also allow a mapping using only
the overhead mics and no room mic to be created without breaking anything, as
each mic's samples have separate groups. Having different polyphony numbers for
different mics can result in an inconsistent sound, so it is not recommended.

```sfz
<group>
off_mode=normal

//Bow hits
<region>
key=51 group=30 off_by=33 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.3
sample=ride_bow_oh.wav
<region>
key=51 group=40 off_by=43 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.4
sample=ride_bow_rm.wav

//Bell hits
<region>
key=53 group=31 off_by=33 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.3
sample=ride_bell_oh.wav
<region>
key=53 group=41 off_by=43 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.4
sample=ride_bell_rm.wav

//Edge hits (crashes)
<region>
key=59 group=32 off_by=33 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.3
sample=ride_edge_oh.wav
<region>
key=59 group=42 off_by=43 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.4
sample=ride_edge_rm.wav

//Edge chokes
<region>
key=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=33
sample=ride_choke_oh.wav
<region>
key=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=43
sample=ride_choke_rm.wav
```

It is also possible to use [note_polyphony] here, which
has the advantage of allowing [note_selfmask] to be used. This is good when
a hard hit is followed by several lighter ones on the same cymbal - using
polyphony, the quieter hits will mute the loud one when the polyphony
limit is reached, which can result in the louder hit's sustain suddenly and unrealistically
vanishing. However, this can cause problems with hi-hats where one MIDI note needs to
trigger several silence groups as well. This is why Virtuosity Drums has the
hi-hat regions set with note_polyphony=MAX, though there might be a better way.

Note_polyphony is also separated by keys; while the polyphony limit under a
group can be tracked together for several keys under one group, note_polyphony
is tracked separately for each MIDI note value.

The above example modified to use note_polyphony instead of polyphony would look
like this:

```sfz
<group>
off_mode=normal

//Bow hits
<region>
key=51 group=30 off_by=33 note_polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.3
sample=ride_bow_oh.wav
<region>
key=51 group=40 off_by=43 note_polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.4
sample=ride_bow_rm.wav

//Bell hits
<region>
key=53 group=31 off_by=33 note_polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.3
sample=ride_bell_oh.wav
<region>
key=53 group=41 off_by=43 note_polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.4
sample=ride_bell_rm.wav

//Edge hits (crashes)
<region>
key=59 group=32 off_by=33 note_polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.3
sample=ride_edge_oh.wav
<region>
key=59 group=42 off_by=43 note_polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.4
sample=ride_edge_rm.wav

//Edge chokes
<region>
key=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=33
sample=ride_choke_oh.wav
<region>
key=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=43
sample=ride_choke_rm.wav
```


## Another approach to limiting polyphony

If there is no need have a choke group, it's possible to limit the polyphony of
a cymbal in a way which is more controllable, by having it self-mute but making
the fadeout time of the previous samples long. This cannot be done when chokes
are required, because chokes need a fast fadeout, but it is another option which
allows how much dense patterns on a cymbal will build up to be controlled with a
MIDI CC parameter - the polyphony opcode cannot be modulated by MIDI CC, but
ampeg_release can. Here is how that might work using CC 100 to modulate the time,
with different maximum times for different articulations, as in general edge hits
will build up the most and bell hits the least. Of course, it's not very possible
to modulate the buildup of a cymbal in the real world, but that doesn't mean it
can't be useful in the sampled world.

```sfz
<group>
off_mode=normal
ampeg_release=0.1

//Bow hits
<region>
key=51 group=30 off_by=30
ampeg_release_oncc100=5
sample=ride_bow_oh.wav
<region>
key=51 group=40 off_by=40
ampeg_release_oncc100=5.7
sample=ride_bow_rm.wav

//Bell hits
<region>
key=53 group=31 off_by=31
ampeg_release_oncc100=3
sample=ride_bell_oh.wav
<region>
key=53 group=41 off_by=41
ampeg_release_oncc100=3.5
sample=ride_bell_rm.wav

//Edge hits (crashes)
<region>
key=59 group=32 off_by=32
ampeg_release_oncc100=7
sample=ride_edge_oh.wav
<region>
key=59 group=42 off_by=42
ampeg_release_oncc100=8
sample=ride_edge_rm.wav
```

## Deep-sampled hi-hat example

Putting most of the above knowledge together into a complex example can result
in long SFZ files, but the principles themselves remain the same. The mapping
for a deeply sampled hi-hat with tightly closed, closed, loosely closed, quarter
open, half open, open, foot chik, foot splash and pedal return samples, with
separate shank and tip hits for tightly closed, closed, loosely closed and
quarter open might look like this:

```sfz
<control>
