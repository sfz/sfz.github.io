layout: "sfz/header"

In [SFZ v1] only [effect1] and [effect2] opcodes was available
and only at [‹region›] level.

From [SFZ v2] this header was added together with the addition of
[effect3] and [effect4] opcodes also to modulate the related bus.
Other opcodes listed in the book are [bus], [type] and [dsp_order].

The specifics of what can be used under this header differ widely
between SFZ players. The information on available effects and
how to control them in ARIA and Cakewalk products can be found on
the [type] page.
