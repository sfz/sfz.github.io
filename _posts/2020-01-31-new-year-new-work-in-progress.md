The most relevant additions on the website for this month were [Instruments]
and [Modulations] sections, adding slowly one by one some sample instruments
libraries created and freely distribuited over the net, and documenting in a
generic way the various modulations used in SFZ.
Some new opcodes were also added in our database, starting from some modulation
aliases like amplitude_ccN, pan_ccN and tune_ccN to the recent fil_gain.
I would like to thank some people who contributed to the site, like falkTX
for adding our news feed on [Linuxaudio Planet], jpcima, MatFluor, PaulFd and sfw.
This website is an opensource non profit project, I hope to see more people
involved in the future to help make it grow.
