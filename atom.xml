		<content type="html"><p>Bootstrap updated to v5.3.0 which supports <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/">color modes</a>, which means that
if your system uses a dark color theme, it will adapt to your visual preferences
on browsers that supports it.
Highlight.js will adapt to the chosen theme, so the sfz examples will be shown with it.</p></content>

		<content type="html"><p>For those who missed it we have some updates on the website, mainly regarding
the opcodes page. Recently I've added a <a href="https://bootstrap-table.com">javascript library</a> that permits tables
column sorting, and now with an awesome contribution from @jpcima also a script
to filter opcode names, versions and categories. Hope you'll find them handy!</p></content>

		<content type="html"><p>A new tutorial about <a href="https://sfzformat.com/tutorials/subtractive_synths">subtractive synthesizers</a> was shared by DSmolken's
sample instruments experience applied in the <a href="https://github.com/sfzinstruments/karoryfer.caveman-cosmonaut">Caveman Cosmonaut</a> sample library.<br>
Some fixes and additions were made in our opcode database and in software as well,
like the Windows <a href="https://openmpt.org/">OpenMPT</a> music tracker by sagamusix.<br>
New contributions was provided by other users like jisaacstone,
and a big contribution from jpcima for the <a href="https://sfzformat.com/opcodes/type#cakewalk-implementation">effects</a> section.<br>
Now we have also a new page for convenience
that lists <a href="https://sfzformat.com/misc/all_opcodes">all opcodes</a> present in our database.</p></content>
